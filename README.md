#CSS-Demo-Site

##Description

This project was built to test my current knowledge and skills in HTML and CSS by editing completed code to make it more maintainable, 
doing things like linking CSS classes to avoid repeated code and changing HTML elements to their correct semantic elements as well as filling in code like alt text to images. 
In doing this mini project I was able to see the incorrect and correct way to write out code as well as figuring out and fix problems as they came up in changing the code.
